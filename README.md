# visual_coverage_control
 
Created and maintained by: Made Widhi Surya Atman

This is a simulation code for visual coverage control algorithm based on [1] and [2].
The algorithm is tested with a simplified simulation scenarios to test image stitiching algorithm with different effects of the control parameter.
